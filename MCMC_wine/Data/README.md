## About the data set

The data I used can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews?resource=download).

The data I've chosen to use is from 'Kaggle' and was scraped from 'WineEnthusiast'

designation, points (quality), price, province, region_1, region_2, taster_name, 
taster_twitter_handle, title, variety, winery.
